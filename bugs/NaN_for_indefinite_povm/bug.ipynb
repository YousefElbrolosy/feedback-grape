    "ISSUE: In this code (which is based upon example_I), NaN values are produced in the fgrape update gradients in optimization step 234. Interestingly, this was only observed for LUT method in example_I.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAUSE: Apparently, the optimizer has problems if parametrized eigenvalues of POVM elements become zero. I interprete that this has to do with probabilities becoming zeros which could cause zero-division errors. In the system studied here, the issue was solved by parametrizing POVM elements such that their eigenvalues are bound between 1e-6 and 1 - 1e-6 instead of bounds between 0 and 1 in line 145 of bug_helpers.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other unsuccessfull attemps of solving the issue were:\n",
    "- Trying out different methods in dynamiqs.mesolve for solving lindblad equation. Only Kvaerno3 was successfull in the example tried out, at the cost of 300x more runtime. There is no guarantee that it always works.\n",
    "- Trying out different error tolerances (atol=1e-10, rtol=1e-10) in mesolve Tsit5 method.\n",
    "- Trying out different values for eps and eps_root in frgrape's adam optimizer, which should avoid division by zeros. It solved some examples but caused the same issue in others.\n",
    "- Changing the clipping of prob in .utils.povm from \"jnp.maximum(prob, 1e-10)\" to \"prob + 1e-6\".\n",
    "- Skipping of updates where nan is detected and re-evaluating batch with different keys -> the re-evaluated batches mostly produced nan values aswell"
