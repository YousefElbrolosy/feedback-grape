FeedbackGRAPE Tutorials
=======================

These tutorials demonstrate advanced feedback-based GRAPE techniques for enhanced quantum control with real-time optimization and adaptive protocols.

.. note::
   These tutorials build upon the concepts from the basic GRAPE tutorials. We recommend completing those first if you're new to GRAPE optimization.
