# feedback-grape

**feedback-grape** is a high-performance Python package for simulating and optimizing quantum systems with feedback. It builds on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) method and introduces a new approach that integrates feedback in a natural, differentiable, and efficient way.

## ðŸ“– References

The feedbackGRAPE method was introduced in:

- Porotti, Peano, Marquardt, PRX Quantum 4, 030305 (2023)  
  [https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030305](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030305)

It extends traditional GRAPE by incorporating feedback control, which is crucial for applications like quantum state stabilization and quantum error correction. It is designed to work seamlessly with neural networks and automatic differentiation frameworks.

A full application to quantum error correction with the GKP code is shown in:

- Puviani et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 020601 (2025)
